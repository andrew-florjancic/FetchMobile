     Also let's leave these not so tasty recipe endpoints here to make my life easier during development.
     If this was a more serious application then I would set up a more in depth demo app to allow the
     user/developer/tester to select from any of these predefined endpoints in addition to offering
     selectable mock responses to easily verify app behavior for odd edge cases like long loading states
     and error states. All of that is out of scope for this project, we currently lack funding $$$ :'(
